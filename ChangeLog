0.06	* In the index, the description: "Conducts Aldrich-McKelvey and Blackbox Scaling (SVD generalization with missing values)" has been changed to "Conducts Aldrich-McKelvey and Blackbox Scaling to Recover Latent Dimensions of Judgment" to avoid prior confusion.

					individuals[[i]][dumpthese,] <- NA
	* Changed:    result <- list(stimuli = stimuli, respondents = as.data.frame(respondents),
	
              eigenvalues = as.numeric(res$eigenvalues),
	
              AMfit = as.numeric(res$fits[1]), R2 = as.numeric(res$fits[2]),
	
              N = nrow(data)-deleted, N.neg = as.integer(res$fits[5]),
	
              N.pos = as.integer(res$fits[4]))
	
	to: result <- list(stimuli = stimuli, respondents = as.data.frame(respondents),
	
              eigenvalues = as.numeric(res$eigenvalues),
	
              AMfit = as.numeric(res$fits[1]), R2 = as.numeric(res$fits[2]),
	
              N =as.integer(res$fits[4])+as.integer(res$fits[5]), N.neg = as.integer(res$fits[5]),
	
              N.pos = as.integer(res$fits[4]))

	* Vignetted updated to drop all references to missing values

0.13	* Commented out the use of .First.lib and .Last.lib to conform to R 3.0.0 per Brian Ripley's suggestion
